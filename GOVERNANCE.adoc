= jmeter-gradle-plugin project governance

== Overview
The *jmeter-gradle-plugin* project uses a governance model commonly described as Benevolent
Dictator For Life (BDFL). This document outlines our understanding of what this
means.

== Roles
* user: anyone who interacts with the *jmeter-gradle-plugin* project
* core contributor: a handful of people who have contributed significantly to
the project by any means (issue triage, support, documentation, code, etc.).
Core contributors are recognizable via GitHub's "Member" badge.
* BDFL: a single individual who makes decisions when consensus cannot be
reached. The current BDFL is https://github.com/mathze[@mathze].

== Decision-making process
In general, we try to reach consensus in discussions. In case consensus cannot
be reached, the BDFL makes a decision.

== Contribution process
The contribution process is described in a separate document called file://./CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING].
